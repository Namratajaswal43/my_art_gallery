        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Namrata, an artist with a passion for capturing the essence of individuals through my portraits. My journey in the world of art began at a young age, and over the years, I have honed my skills in creating both colored and black-and-white portraits.</p>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from the intricate details and unique expressions of each person, my work aims to bring out the personality and emotions of my subjects. Whether it's a vibrant, lifelike colored portrait or a timeless, detailed black-and-white sketch, I strive to create pieces that resonate with viewers and tell a story.</p>
        <p>Through my art, I aim to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and inspire others to see the beauty in every face. Each piece is a reflection of my dedication and love for the craft, as well as my desire to connect with people on a deeper level through my artwork.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my collection. I hope you find as much joy in exploring my portraits as I do in creating them. Feel free to browse through my gallery and connect with me on Instagram for more updates and behind-the-scenes glimpses of my creative process.</p>
